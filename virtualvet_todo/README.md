# VirtualVet ToDo 

VetBable TODO App allows you to add routine and also mark it completed. The app by default marks the routine completed when the time elapsed. I intend to add notification and some other features but that will be a waste of time on my side since it is only a test project.

Since the design lacks functionalty (simulation), it was really difficult for a devloper like me to figure out what each button and pages lead to... A typical example is the complete and edit page.... Nothing was shown in the design and simulation on how to mark the rotine complete and also to edit routine.

I did my best based on the design and I also improved on it... I am confident of my skills anywhere and anytime.... I didn't write test because I don't see the need for it since the app is not going into production.... I also didn't handle the repeat reminder because I will have to write more logic which will take beyond the time specified for this project.

# Suggestion

I suggest that you improve on the design and make it better because that will help developer like me save time, deliver a quality work, app with excellent perfomance and also help avoid a lot bugs.
